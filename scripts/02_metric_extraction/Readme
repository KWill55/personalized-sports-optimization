**Phase 2 Purpose:**  
Extract biomechanical and performance metrics for each free throw.

**Split Phases Purpose:**
* Split phases by elbow extension (find release point)

**Ball Tracking Purpose:**
* calculate make/miss
* calculate other desired metrics

**Player Trackin:**
* Get 2D keypoints from stereo system
* Get 3D keypoints from 2D keypoints 
* visualizations optional 
* save both moment of release and data over time for each free throw 

**Summary Builder:**
* combine player and ball CSVs into a release summary CSV 
* make new CSVs for features and labels
