"""
run_phase2.py

Purpose:
    Run Phase 2 of the free throw analysis pipeline to extract motion and ball metrics,
    producing summarized CSV data ready for analysis and modeling.

Steps:
    1. Split video phases
    2. Run ball tracking and extract metrics (arc, spin, contact, velocity)
    3. Detect 2D and 3D player keypoints
    4. [Optional] Visualize player tracking results
    5. Combine shot metrics into summary CSV
    6. Split summary into features and labels

Control which steps run using the flags in the CONFIG section.
