## **Order of Execution**
1. **generate_grid.py**  
   - Generates a printable checkerboard pattern as **PNG and PDF**.
   - Configure **inner corners** and **square size (cm)** in the script.
   - Print the PDF at **100% scale** for accurate calibration.

2. **check_cb_detection.py**  
   - Streams live feed from both cameras.
   - Ensures cameras can consistently detect the checkerboard.
   - Displays detection stability and alignment feedback (focal length diff, principal point diff, etc.).
   - Adjust lenses until detection is stable before proceeding.

3. **capture_cb_pairs.py**  
   - Captures **synchronized stereo image pairs** of the checkerboard.
   - Saves combined images (1280x640) for calibration.
   - Ensure the checkerboard appears in **different positions, angles, and distances** across multiple captures.
   - Recommended: **15â€“20 pairs** for robust calibration.

4. **calibrate_stereo.py**  
   - Processes saved image pairs and performs **stereo calibration**.
   - Outputs:
     - Intrinsics (K1, K2)
     - Distortion coefficients
     - Rotation (R) and Translation (T)
     - Projection matrices (P1, P2)
   - Saves results to:  
     `data/<ATHLETE>/<SESSION>/calibration/stereo_calibration/stereo_calib.npz`

5. **inspect_calibration.py**  
   - Loads calibration results and displays:
     - Numerical parameters (K1, K2, R, T, etc.)
     - **Undistortion preview**
     - **Rectification preview with epipolar lines**
     - **Optional disparity map** for depth verification
   - Confirms calibration quality visually.

## **Important Notes**
- Keep cameras **fixed after calibration**.
- During capture:
  - Vary checkerboard **position** (top, bottom, sides).
  - Vary **tilt angles** (pitch, yaw, roll).
  - Vary **distance** (close and far).
- Good lighting is critical for accurate corner detection.
