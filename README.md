personalized-sports-optimization

This is a project for the Robotic Vision Lab at Brigham Young University, directed by Dr DJ Lee. 

===================================
Aims of this project:
===================================

Our mission is to help athletess improve basketball free throw consistency through the use of computer vision. A common approach to improve free throws is to imitate the form of a pro NBA athlete, however we believe that every athlete has a unique optimal shooting form, and because of this, we are using AI to extract biomechanics and performance metrics from 3D free motion data to deliver personalized, actionabale feedback for athletes to find the free throw form that works best individually for them. 


===================================
Phase 1: Record 3D Freethrow Data
===================================

TODO: is this better to go over everything here in one read me or to use read mes in each of the 
directories? 

===================================
Phase 2: Extract key metrics
===================================


===================================
Phase 3: Analyze data to produce insights
===================================
